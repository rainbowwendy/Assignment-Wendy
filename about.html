    <h2>About US</h2>
    <p>
      The very first home cleaned by Sunflower Cleaning was in Mississauga,
      Ontario, by our founders Wendy Lee back in 2022. <br />
      The Stringers believed that busy families and homeowners would rather
      spend their time focusing on the more important <br />
      things in life, rather than cleaning their home. It didn’t take long for
      Sunflower Cleaning to become a household name <br />
      in Mississauga and the surrounding area. One reason was because of our
      easily identifiable pink and blue corporate colours. <br />
      In fact, even today many people recognize Sunflower Cleaning by the
      distinctive colours of our vehicles and by our commitment <br />
      to providing the highest quality house cleaning possible.Since 2010,
      Sunflower Cleaning has expanded not only across Canada<br />
      but also into the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Portugal.
      Each year, Sunflower Cleaning Franchises perform <br />
      more than 2 million home cleanings — all from our humble beginnings in
      Mississauga, Ontario. We’re proud of our history and <br />
      of our founders, Adrienne and Chris, for starting what has become one of
      the world’s most successful residential cleaning <br />
      companies.
